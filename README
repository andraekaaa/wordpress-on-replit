**Credits**: [WordPress on Replit by Ethan Pil](https://github.com/ethanpil/wordpress-on-replit)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Use PHP Web Server Template on Replit**.

2. **IMPORTANT**: Always open a new tab window after running the Replit. Keep in mind that the webview in the console is not synchronized with the webview in the new browser tab. 

3. If you encounter errors, you may need to log out of the Replit editor and try reopening your project, or you can try stopping the Replit and then starting it again.

4. To run, just start the project and fill in your site data in the console. (Alternatively, you can stop Replit when entering your username and fill it in the WordPress site instead).

### Error Example:

If you encounter errors similar to the following (just an example):

===============================
Warning: Array to string conversion in /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-config.php on line 91
Warning: Array to string conversion in /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-config.php on line 92
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-config.php:91) in /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-includes/pluggable.php on line 1435
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-config.php:91) in /home/runner/WordPress-on-Replit-01012025/wp-includes/pluggable.php on line 1438
=================================

You can fix this by editing the `wp-config.php` file with the following settings:
================
$_SERVER["HTTPS"] = "on";
define('WP_SITEURL', 'YOUR REPLIT URL / .dev URL HERE');
define('WP_HOME', 'YOUR REPLIT URL  / .dev URL HERE');
define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', false);
=================
- You can find your **Replit URL** or **.dev URL** when you open the new tab in the webview.
- Make sure to **STOP or RESTART** the Replit server after making these changes.
